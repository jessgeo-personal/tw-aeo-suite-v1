## What Counts as "Abuse"

We reserve the right to temporarily suspend or terminate accounts engaging in:

### Prohibited Activities:
❌ **Automated Scraping:** Using bots to scrape competitor data systematically  
❌ **Reselling Access:** Sharing accounts or selling analyses to third parties  
❌ **System Gaming:** Attempting to bypass rate limits or daily caps  
❌ **Resource Hogging:** Running 1000+ analyses in a short period  
❌ **Malicious Use:** Analyzing sites you don't own without permission  
❌ **Reverse Engineering:** Attempting to extract our algorithms

### Examples of Abuse:
- Setting up automated systems to analyze 10,000 URLs daily
- Creating multiple accounts to bypass free tier limits
- Selling AEO reports to clients using a single subscription
- Using the tool to build a competing service

---

## Why These Limits?

**Cost Structure:**
Each analysis requires:
- Server compute time (~2-5 seconds CPU)
- Memory for parsing HTML/JavaScript
- Database storage for results
- Network bandwidth for fetching pages

**Economics:**
- Average cost per analysis: $0.03-0.05
- Free tier subsidized by paid plans
- Unlimited plan profitable at ~150 analyses/day average

**Fair for Everyone:**
- Limits prevent one user from degrading service for others
- Ensures fast response times for all users
- Allows us to maintain affordable pricing

---

## Monitoring & Enforcement

### How We Monitor:
- Real-time rate limiting at application level
- Daily/hourly usage tracking per user
- Automated alerts for unusual patterns
- Manual review for suspected abuse

### Enforcement Actions:
1. **First Violation:** Warning email + temporary rate limit reduction
2. **Second Violation:** 24-hour account suspension
3. **Third Violation:** Permanent account termination (no refund)
